## NBA Player Clustering and Game Win Prediction

### Intro/Background

Basketball is team sport where a game is played among two teams with 5 players each on-court and other players on the bench. The National Basketball Association is professional basketball league in the North America with 30 teams divided into 2 conferences - East and West.

There are few famous players like Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, etc. and naturally there is always the debate of who is the Greatet Of All Time (G.O.A.T). This debate literally goes on till today even if people recognize that all of them are great players in this game.

The players also play specific positions like Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Power Forward, Small Forward, and Center. With time the nature of how players play the game also changed. For example the game now involves a players shooting 3 pointers. A big man (center) - Karl Anthony Towns won this years 3 point contest!

Thus rather than using traditional positions, it would be interesting to know how player relate to others based on their statistics to aid in comparison of players and possibly helping in the G.O.A.T debate!     

Aside from this betting on games is also a aspect of the league with them promoting it like [NBABet](https://www.nba.com/nbabet), [FanDuel](https://www.fanduel.com/tnt), etc.

While people usually just love watching games, betting and winning usually adds on to the excitement. Generally as the season progresses its becomes obvious as to which teams are going to be leader. For eg. in this season the Pheonix Suns and the Golden State Warriors are clear leaders in the Western conference. So for games against these teams against the lower ranked ones the outcomes are obvious. But the games against top teams the outcome is generally difficult to predict but these games are the most exciting ones and generally streams on National TV on broadcasts like TNT, ESPN, etc. Thus using data can help provide better insight for prediciting game outcomes and possibly save money!
